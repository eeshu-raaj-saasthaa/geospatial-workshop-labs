    "# 🧪 Lab 2: Geospatial AI with the Prithvi Foundation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Learn to use a powerful, pre-trained geospatial foundation model (`Prithvi-100M-sen1floods11`) to perform a real-world analysis: **flood segmentation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is important:** This lab demonstrates how to run state-of-the-art AI models *directly within a notebook* using only the **CPU**. This \"local inference\" workflow is a key skill, allowing you to quickly test models and analyze data without complex, expensive GPU infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 What is Prithvi?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prithvi** (Sanskrit for \"Earth\") is a new class of **Geospatial Foundation Model (GFM)** developed by IBM and NASA. Unlike traditional AI models that are trained on one specific task (like *only* floods or *only* burn scars), Prithvi was pre-trained on a massive, diverse dataset of satellite imagery (from the HLS dataset) from across the entire United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"foundation\" training gives it a deep, generalized understanding of what land, water, vegetation, and urban areas look like in different seasons and conditions. We can then \"fine-tune\" this base model for specific tasks. The model we are using today, `Prithvi-100M-sen1floods11`, has been fine-tuned to be an expert at one thing: **identifying water**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will run the entire process—from finding data to visualizing the AI's prediction—right here in this notebook.\n",

    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Foundation Model (FM):** A large AI model (like Prithvi) pre-trained on vast amounts of general data. This \"foundation\" allows it to be easily adapted to new, specific tasks.\n",
    "  * **Inference:** The process of *using* a trained model to make predictions on new data. This is what we are doing today. (The opposite is *training*).\n",
    "  * **STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog):** A modern \"search engine\" or API for geospatial data. We use it to find the exact satellite images we need from cloud providers like the Microsoft Planetary Computer.\n",
    "  * **Sentinel-2:** An advanced Earth observation mission providing high-resolution (10m) optical imagery. Its multiple **spectral bands** (seeing beyond just Red, Green, and Blue) are perfect for AI.\n",
    "  * **GeoTIFF:** A standard file format for satellite images. It's a \"geospatial\" TIFF, meaning it contains crucial metadata like coordinates (latitude/longitude) and the map projection.\n",
    "  * **TerraTorch:** An open-source library used to easily load and work with geospatial foundation models like Prithvi."

    "# 5\\. 🧠 Load AI Model & Run Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core of the lab. The following cell performs the entire AI analysis. Here is a breakdown of what it's doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Define Helper Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * `normalize_and_stack`: This is crucial. Our 6 Sentinel-2 bands have different resolutions (10m and 20m). This function will **reproject** all bands to match a single reference grid, **stack** them into one 6-layer file, and **normalize** the pixel values. Normalization (scaling values to a standard range) is a required step to prepare data for an AI model.\n",
    "      * `resize_tensor`: The original satellite image is *huge* (over 10,000x10,000 pixels). Running the model on the full image would be very slow on a CPU. We resize it to `512x512` for *inference*, and then we will scale the *result* back up. This is a common technique to balance speed and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Download Model Checkpoint:** Downloads the pre-trained `Prithvi-100M-sen1floods11` model weights (`.pth` file) from the **Hugging Face Hub**. This file contains the \"brain\" of the model with all the learned parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Build Model Architecture:** Uses `TerraTorch`'s `EncoderDecoderFactory` to construct the \"empty\" skeleton of the Prithvi model. We then load the downloaded weights (the \"brain\") into this skeleton. We also explicitly set the device to **`cpu`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Prepare Data:** Uses our helper functions to load, stack, normalize, and resize the 6 TIFs into a single `tensor`. A tensor is the primary data structure used by PyTorch, similar to a multi-dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Run Inference:** This is the prediction step. We use `torch.no_grad()` and `model.eval()` to tell PyTorch we are in *inference mode* (predicting), not *training mode*. This makes the process much faster and more memory-efficient. The model's output is a `tensor` where each pixel has two values (a \"score\" for \"Not Water\" and a \"score\" for \"Water\").\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Save the Result:** We take the class with the highest score (using `torch.argmax`) to create a binary mask (0 = Land, 1 = Water). We then resize this small mask back up to the original image's high resolution and save it as a new GeoTIFF file named `flood_mask.tif`."

    "## 7. 🔬 Validating the Result (Ground Truth Check)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model produced a prediction, but how do we know it's accurate? This final step, **validation**, is one of the most important parts of any AI workflow. We need to compare our result to a \"ground truth\" to confirm its real-world value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this in two simple ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 1: Visual Sanity Check (vs. Basemap)\n",
    "Use the layer control (top right) in your interactive map to toggle the \"AI Flood Detection\" layer on and off. Switch the basemap from \"OpenStreetMap\" to \"Satellite\" (often called `Esri.WorldImagery` or similar) to compare satellite-to-satellite.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation 1 (Accuracy):** You should see that the blue overlay perfectly aligns with the permanent river channels (the Mississippi and Yazoo) visible on the satellite basemap. This confirms the model isn't \"hallucinating\" and has a very high spatial accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation 2 (Flooding):** Look closely at the areas outside the main channel, especially near the \"Fort of Vicksburg\" and inside the river bends (oxbows). The blue mask extends beyond the main channel into low-lying floodplain areas. This is the model's \"flood\" detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 2: Real-World Event Verification\n",
    "The visual check strongly suggests flooding, but was there *actually* a flood in Vicksburg when this image was taken (April-May 2023)? This is the \"ground truth\" check.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick search for \"Vicksburg MS flooding April 2023\" confirms our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ground Truth:** The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that the Mississippi River at Vicksburg was in **major flood stage** throughout April and early May 2023. The river crested at over 48 feet (well above the 43-foot flood stage), inundating thousands of acres of surrounding low-lying farmland and floodplain areas—exactly what the model detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏁 Conclusion\n",
    "Our workflow is validated. The `Prithvi-100M-sen1floods11` model:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Correctly identified all permanent water.\n",
    "*   Detected additional surface water in known floodplains.\n",
    "*   This detection matches ground-truth reports of a major, real-world flood event.\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms that the model is not just guessing—it's accurately segmenting a real, ongoing event."
