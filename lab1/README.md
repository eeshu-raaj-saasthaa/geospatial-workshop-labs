# Lab 1: Foundational Geospatial Analysis (Vegetation) with Azure & JupyterLab

This lab provides a hands-on introduction to geospatial data analysis using modern cloud-backed workflows, focusing on how to prepare, manipulate, and visualize spatial datasets within a cloud-hosted JupyterLab compute instance on Azure. You will gain direct experience in environment setup via the terminal, including conda environment management, running analytical notebooks, and working interactively with key Python geospatial libraries. By the end of this lab, you will have executed foundational geospatial pipelines, leveraged cloud computing efficiency, and developed practical skills directly transferable to real-world spatial data projects.

## Setup Requirements

- **Azure for Students Free Credits:**  
  Register for [Azure for Students](https://aka.ms/azure4students) and confirm activation of your complimentary credits (usually $100 for 12 months). No card required.

- **Required Hardware & Software:**
  - Laptop or desktop with a modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
  - Stable internet connection.
  - No local installations needed: all activities run on the Azure-hosted JupyterLab compute instance.

- **JupyterLab Environment:**
  - All exercises occur within one cloud compute instance.
  - Terminal access will be used to create and activate the necessary conda environment using the provided `azureml_environment.yml`.
  - Hands-on steps for working with the environment are included in the main notebook.

## Lab Workflow

1. **Set up your Azure and JupyterLab environment**
2. **Create & activate a custom conda environment using the terminal (`azureml_environment.yml`)**
3. **Ingest and inspect geospatial datasets**
4. **Execute Python-based analytic workflows in the Jupyter notebook**
5. **Visualize spatial data and interpret geospatial results**
